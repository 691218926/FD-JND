**Abstract:**
The perception of visual information of human visual system is a non-uniform process, and it has different distortion sensitivity for different image contents. Previous research has shown that the human visual system cannot perceive the changes or distortions in image content below a certain threshold. This threshold is called the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) threshold. JND threshold estimation of images is of great significance for many perceptual image processing applications such as efficient image compression and information hiding. Generally, luminance adaptation and spatial masking effect are the two major factors that determine the JND threshold. The existing spatial masking models mainly consider two aspects including contrast masking and texture masking. However, the current texture masking model cannot effectively account for the influence of texture roughness on the JND threshold. Meanwhile, research has shown that the human visual system has lower sensitivities for perceiving the changes or differences in image content with rough surfaces. Inspired by this, this paper investigates into the concept of fractal dimension (FD) based on the classic fractal theory to describe the image texture roughness quantitatively and proposes a new texture masking model based on FD. Generally, image areas with higher texture roughness have stronger texture masking effect while areas with lower texture roughness have weaker texture masking effect. Then, we combine our newly proposed texture masking model with traditional contrast masking to derive an improved spatial masking estimation function. Finally, the improved spatial mask estimation function is combined with luminance adaptability function to form the final JND profile. On the other hand, considering the visual attention mechanism of the human visual system, we also refine the JND threshold using the visual saliency map estimated by the classical Graph based Visual Saliency (GBVS) method.
